The program will decipher two text strings which use Caesar's cipher

The character set is const string alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";

The two cipher strings are "uIFzBOLTbSFbMTPlOPXObTuIFcSPOYcPNCFST" "dBFTBSdJQIFSfYFSDJTFxJUIdqMVTqMVT"

The program will figure out the shift number then decipher and print the plain text for both
